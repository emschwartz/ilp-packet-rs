//! # interledger-service
//!
//! This is the core abstraction used across the Interledger.rs implementation.
//!
//! Inspired by [tower](https://github.com/tower-rs), all of the components of this implementation are "services"
//! that take a request type and asynchronously return a result. Every component uses the same interface so that
//! services can be reused and combined into different bundles of functionality.
//!
//! The Interledger service traits use requests that contain ILP Prepare packets and the related `from`/`to` Accounts
//! and asynchronously return either an ILP Fullfill or Reject packet. Implementations of Stores (wrappers around
//! databases) can attach additional information to the Account records, which are then passed through the service chain.
//!
//! ## Example Service Bundles
//!
//! The following examples illustrate how different Services can be chained together to create different bundles of functionality.
//!
//! ### SPSP Sender
//!
//! SPSP Client --> ValidatorService --> RouterService --> HttpOutgoingService
//!
//! ### Connector
//!
//! HttpServerService --> ValidatorService --> RouterService --> BalanceAndExchangeRateService --> ValidatorService --> HttpOutgoingService
//!
//! ### STREAM Receiver
//!
//! HttpServerService --> ValidatorService --> StreamReceiverService
