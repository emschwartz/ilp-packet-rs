# interledger-ildcp

This crate provides an implementation of the [Interledger Dynamic
Configuration Protocol](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0031-dynamic-configuration-protocol/)
(ILDCP), used by clients to query for their ILP address
and asset details such as asset code and scale.
By way of analogy with the internet, this serves a similar purpose to [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol).
