//! # interledger-router
//!
//! A service that routes ILP Prepare packets to the correct next
//! account based on the ILP address in the Prepare packet based
//! on the routing table.
//!
//! A routing table could be as simple as a single entry for the empty prefix
//! ("") that will route all requests to a specific outgoing account.
//!
//! Note that the Router is not responsible for building the routing table,
//! only using the information provided by the store. The routing table in the
//! store can either be configured or populated using the `CcpRouteManager`
//! (see the `interledger-ccp` crate for more details).
