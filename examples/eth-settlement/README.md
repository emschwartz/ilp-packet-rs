# Interledger with Ethereum On-Ledger Settlement
> A demo that sends payments between 2 Interledger.rs nodes and settles using Ethereum transactions.

## Overview
This example shows how to configure Interledger.rs nodes and use an Ethereum network (testnet or mainnet) as a settlement ledger for payments sent between the nodes. If you are new to Ethereum, you can learn about it [here](https://www.ethereum.org/beginners/). To learn about settlement in Interledger, refer to [Peering, Clearing and Settling](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0032-peering-clearing-settlement/0032-peering-clearing-settlement.md).

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](#rust)
- [An Ethereum network](#an-ethereum-network) to connect to
- [Redis](#redis)

### Rust

Because Interledger.rs is written in the Rust language, you need the Rust environment. Refer to the [Getting started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) page or just `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh` and follow the instructions.

### An Ethereum network
First, you need an Ethereum network. You can either use a local testnet, a remote testnet, or the mainnet.

For this example, we'll use [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) which deploys a local Ethereum testnet at `localhost:8545`. To install `ganache-cli`, run `npm install -g ganache-cli`. If you do not already have Node.js installed on your computer, you can follow [the instructions below](#install-nodejs) to install it.

Advanced: You can run this against the Rinkeby Testnet by running a node that connects to Rinkeby (e.g. `geth --rinkeby --syncmode "light"`) or use a third-party node provider such as [Infura](https://infura.io/). You must also [create a wallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) and then obtain funds via the [Rinkeby Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).

#### Install Node.js
(In case you don't have Node.js) There are a few ways to install Node.js. If you work on multiple JavaScript or TypeScript projects which require different `node` versions, using `nvm` may be suitable.

- [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (node version manager)
    - macOS: If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), run `brew install nvm` and you'll see some additional instructions. Follow it and `nvm install node` and `nvm use node`.
    - others: Refer to [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) site.
- Install independently
    - macOS: If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), run `brew install node`
    - Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install nodejs npm`

Then you should be able to use `npm`. To install `ganache-cli`, run `npm install -g ganache-cli`.

### Redis
The Interledger.rs nodes currently use [Redis](https://redis.io/) to store their data (SQL database support coming soon!)

- Compile and install from the source code
    - [Download the source code here](https://redis.io/download)
- Install using package managers
    - Ubuntu: run `sudo apt-get install redis-server`
    - macOS: If you use Homebrew, run `brew install redis`

Make sure your Redis is empty. You could run `redis-cli flushall` to clear all the data.

## Instructions

<!--!
printf "Stopping Interledger nodes\n"

if lsof -Pi :6379 -sTCP:LISTEN -t >/dev/null ; then
    redis-cli -p 6379 shutdown
fi

if [ -f dump.rdb ] ; then
    rm -f dump.rdb
fi

if lsof -tPi :8545 ; then
    kill `lsof -tPi :8545`
fi

if lsof -tPi :7770 ; then
    kill `lsof -tPi :7770`
fi

if lsof -tPi :8770 ; then
    kill `lsof -tPi :8770`
fi

if lsof -tPi :3000 ; then
    kill `lsof -tPi :3000`
fi

if lsof -tPi :3001 ; then
    kill `lsof -tPi :3001`
fi
-->

### 1. Build interledger.rs
First of all, let's build interledger.rs. (This may take a couple of minutes)

<!--! printf "Building interledger.rs... (This may take a couple of minutes)\n" -->
```bash
cargo build --bins
```

### 2. Launch Redis

<!--!
redis-server --version > /dev/null || printf "\e[31mUh oh! You need to install redis-server before running this example\e[m\n"
-->

```bash
# Create the logs directory if it doesn't already exist
mkdir -p logs

# Start Redis
redis-server &> logs/redis.log &
```

When you want to watch logs, use the `tail` command. You can use the command like: `tail -f logs/redis.log`

### 3. Launch Ganache

This will launch an Ethereum testnet with 10 prefunded accounts. The mnemonic is used because we want to know the keys we'll use for Alice and Bob (otherwise they are randomized).

<!--! printf "Starting local Ethereum testnet\n" -->

```bash
ganache-cli -m "abstract vacuum mammal awkward pudding scene penalty purchase dinner depart evoke puzzle" -i 1 &> logs/ganache.log &
```

<!--! sleep 3 -->

### 4. Launch Settlement Engines
Because each node needs its own settlement engine, we need to launch both a settlement engine for Alice's node and another settlement engine for Bob's node.

```bash
# Turn on debug logging for all of the interledger.rs components
export RUST_LOG=interledger=debug

# Start Alice's settlement engine
cargo run --package interledger-settlement-engines -- ethereum-ledger \
--key 380eb0f3d505f087e438eca80bc4df9a7faa24f868e69fc0440261a0fc0567dc \
--confirmations 0 \
--poll_frequency 1000 \
--ethereum_endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
--connector_url http://127.0.0.1:7771 \
--redis_uri redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 \
--watch_incoming true \
--port 3000 \
&> logs/node-alice-settlement-engine.log &

# Start Bob's settlement engine
cargo run --package interledger-settlement-engines -- ethereum-ledger \
--key cc96601bc52293b53c4736a12af9130abf347669b3813f9ec4cafdf6991b087e \
--confirmations 0 \
--poll_frequency 1000 \
--ethereum_endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
--connector_url http://127.0.0.1:8771 \
--redis_uri redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1 \
--watch_incoming true \
--port 3001 \
&> logs/node-bob-settlement-engine.log &
```

### 5. Launch 2 Nodes

```bash
# Start Alice's node
ILP_ADDRESS=example.alice \
ILP_SECRET_SEED=8852500887504328225458511465394229327394647958135038836332350604 \

ILP_DEFAULT_SPSP_ACCOUNT=0 \
cargo run --package interledger -- node &> logs/node-bob.log &
```

<!--!
printf "\nWaiting for Interledger.rs nodes to start up...\n"

function wait_to_serve() {
    while :
    do
        printf "."
        sleep 1
        curl $1 &> /dev/null
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            break;
        fi
    done
}

wait_to_serve "http://localhost:7770"
wait_to_serve "http://localhost:8770"
wait_to_serve "http://localhost:3000"
wait_to_serve "http://localhost:3001"
printf "\n"

printf "The Interledger.rs nodes are up and running!\n\n"
-->

### 6. Configure the Nodes

<!--! printf "Creating accounts:\n" -->

```bash
# Adding settlement accounts should be done at the same time because it checks each other

printf "Adding Alice's account...\n"
curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer hi_alice" \
    -d '{
    "ilp_address": "example.alice",
    "asset_code": "ETH",
    "asset_scale": 18,
    "max_packet_amount": 100,
    "http_incoming_token": "in_alice",
    "http_outgoing_token": "out_alice",
    "http_endpoint": "http://localhost:7770/ilp",
    "settle_to" : 0}' \
    http://localhost:7770/accounts > logs/account-alice-alice.log 2>/dev/null

printf "Adding Bob's Account...\n"
curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer hi_bob" \
    -d '{
    "ilp_address": "example.bob",
    "asset_code": "ETH",
    "asset_scale": 18,
    "max_packet_amount": 100,
    "http_incoming_token": "in_bob",
    "http_outgoing_token": "out_bob",
    "http_endpoint": "http://localhost:8770/ilp",
    "settle_to" : 0}' \
    http://localhost:8770/accounts > logs/account-bob-bob.log 2>/dev/null

printf "Adding Bob's account on Alice's node...\n"
curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer hi_alice" \
    -d '{
    "ilp_address": "example.bob",
    "asset_code": "ETH",
    "asset_scale": 18,
    "max_packet_amount": 100,
    "settlement_engine_url": "http://localhost:3000",
    "http_incoming_token": "bob",
    "http_outgoing_token": "alice",
    "http_endpoint": "http://localhost:8770/ilp",
    "settle_threshold": 500,
    "min_balance": -1000,
    "settle_to" : 0,
    "routing_relation": "Peer",
    "send_routes": true,
    "receive_routes": true}' \
    http://localhost:7770/accounts > logs/account-alice-bob.log 2>/dev/null &

printf "Adding Alice's account on Bob's node...\n"
curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer hi_bob" \
    -d '{
    "ilp_address": "example.alice",
    "asset_code": "ETH",
    "asset_scale": 18,
    "max_packet_amount": 100,
    "settlement_engine_url": "http://localhost:3001",
    "http_incoming_token": "alice",
    "http_outgoing_token": "bob",
    "http_endpoint": "http://localhost:7770/ilp",
    "settle_threshold": 500,
    "min_balance": -1000,
    "settle_to" : 0,
    "routing_relation": "Peer",
    "send_routes": true,
    "receive_routes": true}' \
    http://localhost:8770/accounts > logs/account-bob-alice.log 2>/dev/null &

sleep 2
```

Now two nodes and its settlement engines are set and accounts for each node are also set up.

Notice how we use Alice's settlement engine endpoint while registering Bob. This means that whenever Alice interacts with Bob's account, she'll use that Settlement Engine.

The `settle_threshold` and `settle_to` parameters control when settlements are triggered. The node will send a settlement when an account's balance reaches the `settle_threshold`, and it will settle for `balance - settle_to`.

### 7. Sending a Payment

<!--!
function get_account_id() {
    ACCOUNT_ID=`cat $1 | node -e 'process.stdout.write(JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync("/dev/stdin", "utf8")).id);'`
}

get_account_id logs/account-alice-alice.log
ACCOUNT_ID_ALICE_ALICE=${ACCOUNT_ID}
get_account_id logs/account-alice-bob.log
ACCOUNT_ID_ALICE_BOB=${ACCOUNT_ID}
get_account_id logs/account-bob-alice.log
ACCOUNT_ID_BOB_ALICE=${ACCOUNT_ID}
get_account_id logs/account-bob-bob.log
ACCOUNT_ID_BOB_BOB=${ACCOUNT_ID}

printf "\nChecking balances...\n"

printf "\nAlice's balance on Alice's node: "
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer hi_alice" \
http://localhost:7770/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID_ALICE_ALICE}/balance

printf "\nBob's balance on Alice's node: "
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer bob" \
http://localhost:7770/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID_ALICE_BOB}/balance

printf "\nAlice's balance on Bob's node: "
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer alice" \
http://localhost:8770/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID_BOB_ALICE}/balance

printf "\nBob's balance on Bob's node: "
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer hi_bob" \
http://localhost:8770/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID_BOB_BOB}/balance

printf "\n\n"
-->

First you have to obtain account ids from the logs that were written out when you added the accounts.

```bash #
ACCOUNT_ID_ALICE_ALICE=`../../scripts/get_account_id.sh logs/account-alice-alice.log`
ACCOUNT_ID_ALICE_BOB=`../../scripts/get_account_id.sh logs/account-alice-bob.log`
ACCOUNT_ID_BOB_ALICE=`../../scripts/get_account_id.sh logs/account-bob-alice.log`
ACCOUNT_ID_BOB_BOB=`../../scripts/get_account_id.sh logs/account-bob-bob.log`
```

The following script sends a payment from Alice to Bob.

<!--! printf "Sending payment of 500 from Alice to Bob\n" -->

```bash
curl \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer in_alice" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"receiver\":\"http://localhost:8770/spsp/${ACCOUNT_ID_BOB_BOB}\",\"source_amount\":500}" \
    http://localhost:7770/pay
```

<!--! printf "\n\n" -->

### 8. Check Balances

```bash #
printf "\nAlice's balance on Alice's node: "
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer hi_alice" \
http://localhost:7770/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID_ALICE_ALICE}/balance

printf "\nBob's balance on Alice's node: "
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer bob" \
http://localhost:7770/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID_ALICE_BOB}/balance

printf "\nAlice's balance on Bob's node: "
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer alice" \
http://localhost:8770/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID_BOB_ALICE}/balance

printf "\nBob's balance on Bob's node: "
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer hi_bob" \
http://localhost:8770/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID_BOB_BOB}/balance
```

<!--!
printf "Checking balances...\n"
printf "\nAlice's balance on Alice's node: "
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer hi_alice" \
http://localhost:7770/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID_ALICE_ALICE}/balance

printf "\nBob's balance on Alice's node: "
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer bob" \
http://localhost:7770/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID_ALICE_BOB}/balance

printf "\nAlice's balance on Bob's node: "
AB_BALANCE=`curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer alice" \
http://localhost:8770/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID_BOB_ALICE}/balance 2>/dev/null`
if [[ $AB_BALANCE =~ "-500" ]]; then
    INCOMING_NOT_SETTLED=1
    printf "\e[33m$AB_BALANCE\e[m"
else
    printf $AB_BALANCE
fi

printf "\nBob's balance on Bob's node: "
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer hi_bob" \
http://localhost:8770/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID_BOB_BOB}/balance

if [ $INCOMING_NOT_SETTLED -eq 1 ]; then
    printf "\n\n\e[33mThis means the incoming settlement is not done yet. It will be done once the block is generated.\n"
    printf "Try the following command later:\n\n"
    printf "\tcurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer alice\" http://localhost:8770/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID_BOB_ALICE}/balance\e[m\n\n"
fi
-->

### 9. Kill All the Services
Finally, you can stop all the services as follows:

```bash #
if lsof -Pi :6379 -sTCP:LISTEN -t >/dev/null ; then
    redis-cli -p 6379 shutdown
fi

if [ -f dump.rdb ] ; then
    rm -f dump.rdb
fi

if lsof -tPi :8545 ; then
    kill `lsof -tPi :8545`
fi

if lsof -tPi :7770 ; then
    kill `lsof -tPi :7770`
fi

if lsof -tPi :8770 ; then
    kill `lsof -tPi :8770`
fi

if lsof -tPi :3000 ; then
    kill `lsof -tPi :3000`
fi

if lsof -tPi :3001 ; then
    kill `lsof -tPi :3001`
fi
```

## Advanced

### Check the Settlement Block Generation
To check whether the settlement block is generated, we use `geth`. `geth` is the abbreviation of `go-ethereum` which is an Ethereum client written in the go language. If you don't already have `geth`, refer to the following.

- Compile and install from the source code
    - Refer to [Building Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum) page.
- Install using package managers
    - Ubuntu: Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Installation-Instructions-for-Ubuntu).
    - macOS: If you use Homebrew, run `brew tap ethereum/ethereum` and `brew install ethereum`. Details are found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Installation-Instructions-for-Mac).
    - others: Refer to [Building Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum) page.

Then dump transaction logs as follows. You will see generated block information. Be aware that ganache takes 10 to 20 seconds to generate a block. So you will have to wait for it before you check with `geth`.

<!-- # below means preventing output through run-md.sh -->
```bash #
printf "Last block: "
geth --exec "eth.getTransaction(eth.getBlock(eth.blockNumber-1).transactions[0])" attach http://localhost:8545 2>/dev/null
printf "\nCurrent block: "
geth --exec "eth.getTransaction(eth.getBlock(eth.blockNumber).transactions[0])" attach http://localhost:8545 2>/dev/null
```

<!--!
printf "You could try the following command to check if a block is generated.\nTo check, you'll need to install geth.\n\n"
printf "To check the last block:\n"
printf "\tgeth --exec \"eth.getTransaction(eth.getBlock(eth.blockNumber-1).transactions[0])\" attach http://localhost:8545 2>/dev/null\n\n"
printf "To check the current block:\n"
printf "\tgeth --exec \"eth.getTransaction(eth.getBlock(eth.blockNumber).transactions[0])\" attach http://localhost:8545 2>/dev/null\n"
-->

If you inspect `ganache-cli`'s output, you will notice that the block number has increased as a result of the settlement executions as well.

## Troubleshooting

```
# When installing ganache-cli
gyp ERR! find Python Python is not set from command line or npm configuration
gyp ERR! find Python Python is not set from environment variable PYTHON
gyp ERR! find Python checking if "python" can be used
gyp ERR! find Python - executable path is "/Users/xxxx/anaconda3/bin/python"
gyp ERR! find Python - version is "3.6.2"
gyp ERR! find Python - version is 3.6.2 - should be >=2.6.0 <3.0.0
gyp ERR! find Python - THIS VERSION OF PYTHON IS NOT SUPPORTED
gyp ERR! find Python checking if "python2" can be used
gyp ERR! find Python - "python2" is not in PATH or produced an error
```

If you see an error like the above, you have to install Python 2.7.

```
# When installing Node.js with apt-get
E: Unable to locate package nodejs
E: Unable to locate package npm
```

Try `sudo apt-get update`.

```
# When you try run-md.sh
Fatal: Failed to start the JavaScript console: api modules: Post http://localhost:8545: context deadline exceeded
```

It seems that you failed to install `ganache-cli`. Try to install it.

## Conclusion

This example showed an SPSP payment sent between two Interledger.rs nodes that settled using on-ledger Ethereum transactions.

Check out the [other examples](../README.md) for more complex demos that show other features of Interledger, including multi-hop routing and cross-currency payments.
